			<h3>Introducci√≥n a <span class="red">Grails</span></h3>
			<p>Grails aims to bring the "coding by convention" paradigm to Groovy. It's an open-source web application framework
			that leverages the Groovy language and complements Java Web development. You can use Grails as a standalone
			development environment that hides all configuration details or integrate your Java business logic. Grails aims to
			make development as simple as possible and hence should appeal to a wide range of developers not just those
			from the Java community. Below you can find all you need to know (and more) about Grails.</p>
